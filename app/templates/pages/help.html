        <h2>Help Page</h2>
        <p>
            When searching for audio clips, <b>Hey Gurgle</b> supports two different
            search modes: natural language (default) and boolean. Each mode has
            differing syntax to help narrow down search results.
        </p>

        <h3>Natural Language Mode</h3>
        <p>
            The search mode that is selected by default is natural language mode,
            which allows for searching using more natural phrases and accepts
            the use of quotes to search for the literal word(s) enclosed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Natural language mode does not provide additional operators to exclude
            words or further refinement of search results.
        </p>

        <h3>Boolean Mode</h3>
        <p>
            If you need to refine search results to include or exclude certain words,
            boolean mode will need to be used. The following table has a list of a few
            of the operators that are available for use in boolean mode. The
            <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fulltext-boolean.html">Boolean
            Full-Text Searches</a> page in the MySQL Server 8.4 documentation has more
            detailed information and the full list of operators.
        </p>

        <p>
            As with natural language mode, the use of quotes to search for the literal
            word(s) enclosed.
        </p>

                                A word that does not have an associated operator will be treated
                                as an optional word in the search results.

                                Adding the plus sign to the start or end of a word indicates
                                that the word is required to be present in all of the
                                returned search results.

                                Adding the minus sign to the start or end of a word indicates
                                that the word is required to not appear in all of the
                                returned search results.

                            <td>
                                Adding the tilde to the start of a word reduces the relevancy
                                of the word within search results. This can be useful to filter
                                out words that appear in multiple search results but are not
                                relevant for the intended search.
                            </td>
                        <tr>
                            <td><code>(</code> <code>)</code></td>
                            <td>
                                Words can be grouped together to form subexpressions.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
